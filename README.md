> For your daily dose of misquoted, feel-good, self-referential wisdom.

**Comfucius** is a quote generator that produces completely fake, pseudo-philosophical sayings attributed to famous thinkers. Inspired by motivational social media posts, but with a wink.

  - **Everyone gets the same quote**
  - Quote changes once in a while
- Lightweight, mobile-friendly frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Dimension theme derived from [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net/)/[Pixelarity](https://pixelarity.com/)), a sprinkle of JS
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Caching**: Redis

## üß∞ Optional: Redis for Caching

If you have Redis installed, Comfucius will use it to cache previously generated quotes.

Redis is not strictly required ‚Äî the app will still work without it ‚Äî but you‚Äôll only see placeholder text if Redis is unavailable.

You can configure the Redis hostname using an environment variable:

```bash
export COMFUCIUS_REDISHOST=localhost
```

Default Redis settings:

- Host: `localhost` (or value from `COMFUCIUS_REDISHOST`)
- Port: `6379`
- DB: `0`
